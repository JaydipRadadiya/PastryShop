#### Demo application for delicious pastries shop.

## Features:
- Beautiful animations.
- Offline first approach. All the network responses are cached into the database (powered by [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)).
- Uses android architecture components.
- Follows MVVM architecture pattern.
- Uses dagger heavily to provide clear separation between different architecture layers. Helps to write testable code.
- Mocking database, shared preferences and web server to write accurate tests.
- Single activity application.

## How to run tests?
- Make sure you connect physical device or run an emulator before running the UI tests.
- To run tests, run following command:
```bash
./gradlew cAT
```

## Acknowledgement:
- This application implements the design and animations from the beautiful post on [uplabs](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/restaurant-app-for-android). (There are some changes in resources such as fonts, images and texts from the original mock up.)
- Code coverage currently displays percentage of code tested by the unit tests. (UI tests are not being performed on CI server.)
